  "description": "Fixes a bug in the bundled installer caused by a dependency using `setup_requires`. pip doesn't manage these setup time dependencies, so we have to manually handle them. This fixes the issue where running the bundled installer on a machine without internet access would fail since we were not bundling all the transitive dependencies."
