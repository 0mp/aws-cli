  "description": "Revert pr that added support for comments https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/pull/4873. Comment support also changed from using the 'safe' yaml representer to the 'rt' (round trip) yaml representer. In some cases this causes the `package` command to emit yaml that the CloudFormation service cannot parse, resulting in a service error."
