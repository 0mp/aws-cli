.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The describe\-images operation returns information about AMIs, AKIs, and ARIs
available to the user. Information returned includes image type, product codes,
architecture, and kernel and RAM disk IDs. Images available to the user include
public images available for any user to launch, private images owned by the user
making the request, and private images owned by other users for which the user
has explicit launch permissions.
.sp
Launch permissions fall into three categories:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPublic:\fP The owner of the AMI granted launch permissions for the AMI to the
all group. All users have launch permissions for these AMIs.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBExplicit:\fP The owner of the AMI granted launch permissions to a specific
user.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBImplicit:\fP A user has implicit launch permissions for all AMIs he or she
owns.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The list of AMIs returned can be modified by specifying AMI IDs, AMI owners, or
users with launch permissions. If no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns
all AMIs for which the user has launch permissions.
.sp
If you specify one or more AMI IDs, only AMIs that have the specified IDs are
returned. If you specify an invalid AMI ID, a fault is returned. If you specify
an AMI ID for which you do not have access, it will not be included in the
returned results.
.sp
If you specify one or more AMI owners, only AMIs from the specified owners and
for which you have access are returned. The results can include the account IDs
of the specified owners, amazon for AMIs owned by Amazon or self for AMIs that
you own.
.sp
If you specify a list of executable users, only users that have launch
permissions for the AMIs are returned. You can specify account IDs (if you own
the AMI(s)), self for AMIs for which you own or have explicit permissions, or
all for public AMIs.
.IP Note
Deregistered images are included in the returned results for an unspecified
interval after deregistration.

.TP
.B \fB\-\-owners\fP  (list of string)
The optional list of owners for the described AMIs. The IDs amazon, self, and
explicit can be used to include AMIs owned by Amazon, AMIs owned by the user,
and AMIs for which the user has explicit launch permissions, respectively.

.B \fB\-\-filters\fP  (list)
A list of filters used to match properties for Images. For a complete
reference to the available filter keys for this operation, see the \fI\%Amazon EC2
API reference\fP .
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B (structure)
A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple values can be
specified per filter. A tag must match at least one of the specified values
for it to be returned from an operation.
.sp
Wildcards can be included in filter values; \fB*\fP specifies that zero or
more characters must match, and \fB?\fP specifies that exactly one character
must match. Use a backslash to escape special characters. For example, a
filter value of \fB\e*amazon\e?\e\e\fP specifies the literal string \fB*amazon?\e\fP
.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBvalues\fP  (list of string)
Contains one or more values for the filter.
.TP
.B \fBname\fP  (string)
Specifies the name of the filter.

the sender of the request has explicit launch permissions, or \(aqall\(aq to return
AMIs with public launch permissions.

The device name (for example, /dev/sdh) for the Amazon EBS volume.
.TP
.B \fBblock\-device\-mapping.snapshot\-id\fP
The ID of the snapshot used for the Amazon EBS volume.
.TP
.B \fBblock\-device\-mapping.volume\-size\fP
The volume size of the Amazon EBS volume, in GiB.
.TP
.B \fBblock\-device\-mapping.volume\-type\fP
The volume type of the Amazon EBS volume.
