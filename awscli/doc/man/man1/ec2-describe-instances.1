.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The describe\-instances operation returns information about instances that you
own.
.sp
If you specify one or more instance IDs, Amazon EC2 returns information for
those instances. If you do not specify instance IDs, Amazon EC2 returns
information for all relevant instances. If you specify an invalid instance ID, a
fault is returned. If you specify an instance that you do not own, it will not
be included in the returned results.
.sp
Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This
interval is usually less than one hour.

.TP
.B \fB\-\-filters\fP  (list)
A list of filters used to match properties for Instances. For a complete
reference to the available filter keys for this operation, see the \fI\%Amazon EC2
API reference\fP .

.TP
.B (structure)
A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple values can be
specified per filter. A tag must match at least one of the specified values
for it to be returned from an operation.
.sp
Wildcards can be included in filter values; \fB*\fP specifies that zero or
more characters must match, and \fB?\fP specifies that exactly one character
must match. Use a backslash to escape special characters. For example, a
filter value of \fB\e*amazon\e?\e\e\fP specifies the literal string \fB*amazon?\e\fP
.
