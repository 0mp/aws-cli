.B (structure)
A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple values can be
specified per filter. A tag must match at least one of the specified values
for it to be returned from an operation.
.sp
Wildcards can be included in filter values; \fB*\fP specifies that zero or
more characters must match, and \fB?\fP specifies that exactly one character
must match. Use a backslash to escape special characters. For example, a
filter value of \fB\e*amazon\e?\e\e\fP specifies the literal string \fB*amazon?\e\fP
.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBvalues\fP  (list of string)
Contains one or more values for the filter.
.TP
.B \fBname\fP  (string)

.TP
.B \fBaddresses.association.owner\-id\fP
The owner ID of the addresses associated with the network interface.
.TP
.B \fBaddresses.association.public\-ip\fP
The association ID returned when the network interface was associated with the
Elastic IP address.
.TP
.B \fBaddresses.primary\fP
Whether the private IP address is the primary IP address associated with the
network interface.
.TP
.B \fBaddresses.private\-ip\-address\fP
The private IP addresses associated with the network interface.
.TP
.B \fBassociation.allocation\-id\fP
The allocation ID that AWS returned when you allocated the Elastic IP address
for your network interface.
.TP
.B \fBassociation.association\-id\fP
The association ID returned when the network interface was associated with an
IP address.
.TP
.B \fBassociation.ip\-owner\-id\fP
The owner of the Elastic IP address associated with the network interface.
.TP
.B \fBassociation.public\-ip\fP
The address of the Elastic IP address bound to the network interface.
.TP
.B \fBattachment.attach.time\fP
The time that the network interface was attached to an instance.
.TP
.B \fBattachment.attachment\-id\fP
The ID of the interface attachment.
.TP
.B \fBattachment.delete\-on\-termination\fP
Indicates whether the attachment is deleted when an instance is terminated.
.TP
.B \fBattachment.device\-index\fP
The device index to which the network interface is attached.
.TP
.B \fBattachment.instance\-id\fP
The ID of the instance to which the network interface is attached.
.TP
.B \fBattachment.instance\-owner\-id\fP
The owner ID of the instance to which the network interface is attached.
.TP
.B \fBattachment.status\fP
The status of the attachment.
Valid Values: \fBattaching|attached|detaching|detached\fP
.TP
.B \fBavailability\-zone\fP
The Availability Zone of the network interface.
.TP
.B \fBdescription\fP
The description of the network interface.
.TP
.B \fBgroup\-id\fP
The ID of a security group associated with the network interface.
.TP
.B \fBgroup\-name\fP
The name of a security group associated with the network interface.
.TP
.B \fBmac\-address\fP
The MAC address of the network interface.
.TP
.B \fBnetwork\-interface\-id\fP
The ID of the network interface.
.TP
.B \fBowner\-id\fP
The AWS account ID of the network interface owner.
.TP
.B \fBprivate\-dns\-name\fP
The private DNS name of the network interface.
.TP
.B \fBprivate\-ip\-address\fP
The private IP address or addresses of the network interface.
.TP
.B \fBrequester\-id\fP
The ID of the entity that launched the instance on your behalf (for example,
AWS Management Console, Auto Scaling, and so on).
.TP
.B \fBrequester\-managed\fP
Indicates whether the network interface is being managed by an AWS service
(for example, AWS Management Console, Auto Scaling, and so on).
.TP
.B \fBsource\-dest\-check\fP
Indicates whether the network interface performs source/destination checking.
A value of true means checking is enabled, and false means checking is
disabled. The value must be false for the network interface to perform Network
Address Translation (NAT) in your VPC.
.TP
.B \fBstatus\fP
The status of the network interface. If the network interface is not attached
to an instance, the status shows available ; if a network interface is
attached to an instance the status shows in\-use .
Valid Values: \fBavailable|in\-use\fP
.TP
.B \fBsubnet\-id\fP
The ID of the subnet for the network interface.
.TP
.B \fBtag\-key\fP
The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the
tag\-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter " tag\-key=Purpose "
and the filter " tag\-value=X ", you get any resources assigned both the tag
key Purpose (regardless of what the tag\(aqs value is), and the tag value X
(regardless of what the tag\(aqs key is). If you want to list only resources
where Purpose is X, see the key filter later in this table.
.TP
.B \fBtag\-value\fP
The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the
tag\-key filter.
.TP
.B \fBtag:\fP
\-\-filters the response based on a specific tag/value combination.
.TP
.B \fBvpc\-id\fP
The ID of the VPC for the network interface.
