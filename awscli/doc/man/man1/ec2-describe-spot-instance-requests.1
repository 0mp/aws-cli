.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Describes Spot Instance requests. Spot Instances are instances that Amazon EC2
starts on your behalf when the maximum price that you specify exceeds the
current Spot Price. Amazon EC2 periodically sets the Spot Price based on
available Spot Instance capacity and current spot instance requests. For
conceptual information about Spot Instances, refer to the \fI\%Amazon Elastic
Compute Cloud Developer Guide\fP or
\fI\%Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide\fP .
.sp
You can filter the results to return information only about Spot Instance
requests that match criteria you specify. For example, you could get information
about requests where the Spot Price you specified is a certain value (you can\(aqt
use greater than or less than comparison, but you can use \fB*\fP and \fB?\fP
wildcards). You can specify multiple values for a filter. A Spot Instance
request must match at least one of the specified values for it to be included in
the results.
.sp
You can specify multiple filters (e.g., the Spot Price is equal to a particular
value, and the instance type is \fBm1.small\fP ). The result includes information
for a particular request only if it matches all your filters. If there\(aqs no
match, no special message is returned; the response is simply empty.
.sp
You can use wildcards with the filter values: an asterisk matches zero or more
characters, and \fB?\fP matches exactly one character. You can escape special
characters using a backslash before the character. For example, a value of
\fB\e*amazon\e?\e\e\fP searches for the literal string \fB*amazon?\e\fP .

.B (structure)
A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple values can be
specified per filter. A tag must match at least one of the specified values
for it to be returned from an operation.
.sp
Wildcards can be included in filter values; \fB*\fP specifies that zero or
more characters must match, and \fB?\fP specifies that exactly one character
must match. Use a backslash to escape special characters. For example, a
filter value of \fB\e*amazon\e?\e\e\fP specifies the literal string \fB*amazon?\e\fP
.
