.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Gives you information about your VPN connections.
.IP Warning
We strongly recommend you use HTTPS when calling this operation because the
response contains sensitive cryptographic information for configuring your
customer gateway.
.sp
You can filter the results to return information only about VPN connections
that match criteria you specify. For example, you could ask to get information
about a particular VPN connection (or all) only if the VPN\(aqs state is pending
or available. You can specify multiple filters (e.g., the VPN connection is
associated with a particular VPN gateway, and the gateway\(aqs state is pending
or available). The result includes information for a particular VPN connection
only if the VPN connection matches all your filters. If there\(aqs no match, no
special message is returned; the response is simply empty. The following table
shows the available filters.

.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-filters\fP  (list)
A list of filters used to match properties for VPN Connections. For a complete
reference to the available filter keys for this operation, see the \fI\%Amazon EC2
API reference\fP .
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B (structure)
A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple values can be
specified per filter. A tag must match at least one of the specified values
for it to be returned from an operation.
.sp
Wildcards can be included in filter values; \fB*\fP specifies that zero or
more characters must match, and \fB?\fP specifies that exactly one character
must match. Use a backslash to escape special characters. For example, a
filter value of \fB\e*amazon\e?\e\e\fP specifies the literal string \fB*amazon?\e\fP
.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBvalues\fP  (list of string)
Contains one or more values for the filter.
.TP
.B \fBname\fP  (string)
Specifies the name of the filter.

.SH FILTERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBbgp\-asn\fP
The BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) associated with a BGP device.
.TP
.B \fBcustomer\-gateway\-configuration\fP
The configuration information for the customer gateway.
.TP
.B \fBcustomer\-gateway\-id\fP
The ID of a customer gateway associated with the VPN connection.
.TP
.B \fBoption.static\-routes\-only\fP
Indicates whether the connection has static routes only. Used for devices that
do not support Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
.TP
.B \fBroute.destination\-cidr\-block\fP
The destination CIDR block. This corresponds to the subnet used in a customer
data center.
.TP
.B \fBstate\fP
The state of the VPN connection.
Valid Values: \fBpending|available|deleting|deleted\fP
.TP
.B \fBtag\-key\fP
The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the
tag\-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter " tag\-key=Purpose "
and the filter " tag\-value=X ", you get any resources assigned both the tag
key Purpose (regardless of what the tag\(aqs value is), and the tag value X
(regardless of what the tag\(aqs key is). If you want to list only resources
where Purpose is X, see the key filter later in this table.
.TP
.B \fBtag\-value\fP
The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the
tag\-key filter.
.TP
.B \fBtag:\fP
\-\-filters the response based on a specific tag/value combination.
.TP
.B \fBtype\fP
The type of VPN connection. Currently the only supported type is ipsec.1 .
Valid Values: \fBipsec.1\fP
.TP
.B \fBvpn\-connection\-id\fP
The ID of the VPN connection.
.TP
.B \fBvpn\-gateway\-id\fP
The ID of a virtual private gateway associated with the VPN connection.
