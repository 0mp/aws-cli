describe-customer-gateways
**************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Gives you information about your customer gateways. You can filter the
results to return information only about customer gateways that match
criteria you specify. For example, you could ask to get information
about a particular customer gateway (or all) only if the gateway's
state is pending or available. You can specify multiple filters (e.g.,
the customer gateway has a particular IP address for the Internet-
routable external interface, and the gateway's state is pending or
available). The result includes information for a particular customer
gateway only if the gateway matches all your filters. If there's no
match, no special message is returned; the response is simply empty.
The following table shows the available filters.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws ec2 describe-customer-gateways
     [--customer-gateway-ids <value>]
     [--filters <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--customer-gateway-ids"  (list of string)
   A set of one or more customer gateway IDs.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for Customer Gateways.
   For a complete reference to the available filter keys for this
   operation, see the Amazon EC2 API reference .

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

         "values"  (list of string)
            Contains one or more values for the filter.

         "name"  (string)
            Specifies the name of the filter.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      [
        {
          "values":
            ["string", ...],
          "name": "string"
        }
        ...
      ]


FILTERS
=======

"bgp-asn"
   The customer gateway's Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous
   System Number (ASN).

"customer-gateway-id"
   The ID of the customer gateway.

"ip-address"
   The IP address of the customer gateway's Internet-routable external
   interface (for example, 12.1.2.3).

"state"
   The state of the customer gateway. Valid Values:
   "pending|available|deleting|deleted"

"tag-key"
   The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both
   the filter " tag-key=Purpose " and the filter " tag-value=X ", you
   get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of
   what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what
   the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose
   is X, see the key filter later in this table.

"tag-value"
   The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-key filter.

"tag:"
   --filters the response based on a specific tag/value combination.

"type"
   The type of customer gateway. Currently the only supported type is
   ipsec.1 . Valid Values: "ipsec.1"
