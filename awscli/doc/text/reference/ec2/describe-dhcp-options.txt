*********************


DESCRIPTION

* The options


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws ec2 describe-dhcp-options
     [--dhcp-options-ids <value>]
     [--filters <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--dhcp-options-ids"  (list of string)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for DhcpOptions. For a
   complete reference to the available filter keys for this operation,
   see the Amazon EC2 API reference .

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

         "values"  (list of string)
            Contains one or more values for the filter.

         "name"  (string)
            Specifies the name of the filter.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      [
        {
          "values":
            ["string", ...],
          "name": "string"
        }
        ...
      ]


FILTERS
=======

"dhcp-options-id"
   The ID of a set of DHCP options.

"key"
   The key for one of the options (for example, domain-name ).

"tag-key"
   The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both
   the filter " tag-key=Purpose " and the filter " tag-value=X ", you
   get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of
   what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what
   the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose
   is X, see the key filter later in this table.

"tag-value"
   The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-key filter.

"tag:"
   --filters the response based on a specific tag/value combination.

"value"
   The value for one of the options.
