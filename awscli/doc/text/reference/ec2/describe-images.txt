describe-images
***************


DESCRIPTION
===========

The describe-images operation returns information about AMIs, AKIs,
and ARIs available to the user. Information returned includes image
type, product codes, architecture, and kernel and RAM disk IDs. Images
available to the user include public images available for any user to
launch, private images owned by the user making the request, and
private images owned by other users for which the user has explicit
launch permissions.

Launch permissions fall into three categories:

* **Public:** The owner of the AMI granted launch permissions for the
  AMI to the all group. All users have launch permissions for these
  AMIs.

* **Explicit:** The owner of the AMI granted launch permissions to a
  specific user.

* **Implicit:** A user has implicit launch permissions for all AMIs he
  or she owns.

The list of AMIs returned can be modified by specifying AMI IDs, AMI
owners, or users with launch permissions. If no options are specified,
Amazon EC2 returns all AMIs for which the user has launch permissions.

If you specify one or more AMI IDs, only AMIs that have the specified
IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid AMI ID, a fault is
returned. If you specify an AMI ID for which you do not have access,
it will not be included in the returned results.

If you specify one or more AMI owners, only AMIs from the specified
owners and for which you have access are returned. The results can
include the account IDs of the specified owners, amazon for AMIs owned
by Amazon or self for AMIs that you own.

If you specify a list of executable users, only users that have launch
permissions for the AMIs are returned. You can specify account IDs (if
you own the AMI(s)), self for AMIs for which you own or have explicit
permissions, or all for public AMIs.

Note: Deregistered images are included in the returned results for an
  unspecified interval after deregistration.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws ec2 describe-images
     [--owners <value>]
     [--image-ids <value>]
     [--filters <value>]
     [--executable-users <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--owners"  (list of string)
   The optional list of owners for the described AMIs. The IDs amazon,
   self, and explicit can be used to include AMIs owned by Amazon,
   AMIs owned by the user, and AMIs for which the user has explicit
   launch permissions, respectively.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--image-ids"  (list of string)
   An optional list of the AMI IDs to describe. If not specified, all
   AMIs will be described.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for Images. For a
   complete reference to the available filter keys for this operation,
   see the Amazon EC2 API reference .

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

         "values"  (list of string)
            Contains one or more values for the filter.

         "name"  (string)
            Specifies the name of the filter.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      [
        {
          "values":
            ["string", ...],
          "name": "string"
        }
        ...
      ]

"--executable-users"  (list of string)
   The optional list of users with explicit launch permissions for the
   described AMIs. The user ID can be a user's account ID, 'self' to
   return AMIs for which the sender of the request has explicit launch
   permissions, or 'all' to return AMIs with public launch
   permissions.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]


FILTERS
=======

"architecture"
   The image architecture. Valid Values: "i386|x86_64"

"block-device-mapping.delete-on-termination"
   Whether the Amazon EBS volume is deleted on instance termination.

"block-device-mapping.device-name"
   The device name (for example, /dev/sdh) for the Amazon EBS volume.

"block-device-mapping.snapshot-id"
   The ID of the snapshot used for the Amazon EBS volume.

"block-device-mapping.volume-size"
   The volume size of the Amazon EBS volume, in GiB.

"block-device-mapping.volume-type"
   The volume type of the Amazon EBS volume. Valid Values:
   "standard|io1"

"description"
   The description of the image (provided during image creation).

"hypervisor"
   The hypervisor type. Valid Values: "ovm|xen"

"image-id"
   The ID of the image.

"image-type"
   The image type. Valid Values: "machine|kernel|ramdisk"

"is-public"
   Whether the image is public.

"kernel-id"
   The kernel ID.

"manifest-location"
   The location of the image manifest.

"name"
   The name of the AMI (provided during image creation).

"owner-alias"
   The AWS account alias (for example, amazon ).

"owner-id"
   The AWS account ID of the image owner.

"platform"
   The platform. To only list Windows-based AMIs, use windows .
   Otherwise, leave blank.

"product-code"
   The product code.

"product-code.type"
   The type of the product code. Valid Values: "devpay|marketplace"

"ramdisk-id"
   The RAM disk ID.

"root-device-name"
   The name of the root device volume (for example, /dev/sda1).

"root-device-type"
   The type of the root device volume. Valid Values: "ebs|instance-
   store"

"state-reason-message"
   The message for the state change.

"tag-key"

   the filter " tag-key=Purpose " and the filter " tag-value=X ", you
   get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of
   what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what
   the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose
   is X, see the key filter later in this table.

"tag-value"
   The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-key filter.

"tag:"
   --filters the response based on a specific tag/value combination.
