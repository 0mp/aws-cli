describe-instances
******************


DESCRIPTION
===========

The describe-instances operation returns information about instances
that you own.

If you specify one or more instance IDs, Amazon EC2 returns
information for those instances. If you do not specify instance IDs,
Amazon EC2 returns information for all relevant instances. If you
specify an invalid instance ID, a fault is returned. If you specify an
instance that you do not own, it will not be included in the returned
results.

Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results.
This interval is usually less than one hour.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws ec2 describe-instances
     [--filters <value>]
     [--instance-ids <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for Instances. For a
   complete reference to the available filter keys for this operation,
   see the Amazon EC2 API reference .

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

         "values"  (list of string)
            Contains one or more values for the filter.

         "name"  (string)
            Specifies the name of the filter.

   *Parameter Syntax*

        {
          "values":
            ["string", ...],
          "name": "string"
        }
        ...

   get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of
   what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what
   the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose
   is X, see the key filter later in this table.

   independent of the tag-key filter.
