describe-internet-gateways
**************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Gives you information about your Internet gateways. You can filter the
results to return information only about Internet gateways that match
criteria you specify. For example, you could get information only
about gateways with particular tags. The Internet gateway must match
at least one of the specified values for it to be included in the
results.

You can specify multiple filters (e.g., the Internet gateway is
attached to a particular VPC and is tagged with a particular value).
The result includes information for a particular Internet gateway only
if the gateway matches all your filters. If there's no match, no
special message is returned; the response is simply empty.

You can use wildcards with the filter values: an asterisk matches zero
or more characters, and "?" matches exactly one character. You can
escape special characters using a backslash before the character. For
example, a value of "\*amazon\?\\" searches for the literal string
"*amazon?\" .


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws ec2 describe-internet-gateways
     [--internet-gateway-ids <value>]
     [--filters <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--internet-gateway-ids"  (list of string)
   One or more Internet gateway IDs.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for Internet Gateways.
   For a complete reference to the available filter keys for this
   operation, see the Amazon EC2 API reference .

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

         "values"  (list of string)
            Contains one or more values for the filter.

         "name"  (string)
            Specifies the name of the filter.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      [
        {
          "values":
            ["string", ...],
          "name": "string"
        }
        ...
      ]


FILTERS
=======

"attachment.state"
   The current state of the attachment between the gateway and the
   VPC. Returned only if a VPC is attached.

"attachment.vpc-id"
   The ID of an attached VPC.

"internet-gateway-id"
   The ID of the Internet gateway.

"tag-key"
   The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both
   the filter " tag-key=Purpose " and the filter " tag-value=X ", you
   get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of
   what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what
   the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose
   is X, see the key filter later in this table.

"tag-value"
   The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-key filter.

"tag:"
   --filters the response based on a specific tag/value combination.
