describe-network-acls
*********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Gives you information about the network ACLs in your VPC. You can
filter the results to return information only about ACLs that match
criteria you specify. For example, you could get information only the
ACL associated with a particular subnet. The ACL must match at least
one of the specified values for it to be included in the results.

You can specify multiple filters (e.g., the ACL is associated with a
particular subnet and has an egress entry that denies traffic to a
particular port). The result includes information for a particular ACL
only if it matches all your filters. If there's no match, no special
message is returned; the response is simply empty.

You can use wildcards with the filter values: an asterisk matches zero
or more characters, and "?" matches exactly one character. You can
escape special characters using a backslash before the character. For
example, a value of "\*amazon\?\\" searches for the literal string
"*amazon?\" .


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws ec2 describe-network-acls
     [--network-acl-ids <value>]
     [--filters <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--network-acl-ids"  (list of string)
   One or more network ACL IDs.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for Network ACLs. For a
   complete reference to the available filter keys for this operation,
   see the Amazon EC2 API reference .

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

         "values"  (list of string)
            Contains one or more values for the filter.

         "name"  (string)
            Specifies the name of the filter.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      [
        {
          "values":
            ["string", ...],
          "name": "string"
        }
        ...
      ]


FILTERS
=======

"association.association-id"
   The ID of an association ID for the ACL.

"association.network-acl-id"
   The ID of the network ACL involved in the association.

"association.subnet-id"
   The ID of the subnet involved in the association.

"default"
   Indicates whether the ACL is the default network ACL for the VPC.

"entry.cidr"
   The CIDR range specified in the entry.

"entry.egress"
   Indicates whether the entry applies to egress traffic.

"entry.icmp.code"
   The ICMP code specified in the entry, if any.

"entry.icmp.type"
   The ICMP type specified in the entry, if any.

"entry.port-range.from"
   The start of the port range specified in the entry.

"entry.port-range.to"
   The end of the port range specified in the entry.

"entry.protocol"
   The protocol specified in the entry. Valid Values: "tcp|udp|icmp"

"entry.rule-action"
   Indicates whether the entry allows or denies the matching traffic.
   Valid Values: "allow|deny"

"entry.rule-number"
   The number of an entry (i.e., rule) in the ACL's set of entries.

"network-acl-id"
   The ID of the network ACL.

"tag-key"
   The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both
   the filter " tag-key=Purpose " and the filter " tag-value=X ", you
   get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of
   what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what
   the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose
   is X, see the key filter later in this table.

"tag-value"
   The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-key filter.

"tag:"
   --filters the response based on a specific tag/value combination.

"vpc-id"
   The ID of the VPC for the network ACL.
