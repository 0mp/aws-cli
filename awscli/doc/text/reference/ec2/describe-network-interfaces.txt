DESCRIPTION

SYNOPSIS
========

   aws ec2 describe-network-interfaces
     [--network-interface-ids <value>]
     [--filters <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--network-interface-ids"  (list of string)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--filters"  (list)
      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

         "values"  (list of string)
            Contains one or more values for the filter.

         "name"  (string)
            Specifies the name of the filter.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      [
        {
          "values":
            ["string", ...],
          "name": "string"
        }
        ...
      ]


FILTERS
=======

"addresses.association.owner-id"
   The owner ID of the addresses associated with the network
   interface.

"addresses.association.public-ip"
   The association ID returned when the network interface was
   associated with the Elastic IP address.

"addresses.primary"
   Whether the private IP address is the primary IP address associated
   with the network interface.

"addresses.private-ip-address"
   The private IP addresses associated with the network interface.

"association.allocation-id"
   The allocation ID that AWS returned when you allocated the Elastic
   IP address for your network interface.

"association.association-id"
   The association ID returned when the network interface was
   associated with an IP address.

"association.ip-owner-id"
   The owner of the Elastic IP address associated with the network
   interface.

"association.public-ip"
   The address of the Elastic IP address bound to the network
   interface.

"attachment.attach.time"
   The time that the network interface was attached to an instance.

"attachment.attachment-id"
   The ID of the interface attachment.

"attachment.delete-on-termination"
   Indicates whether the attachment is deleted when an instance is
   terminated.

"attachment.device-index"
   The device index to which the network interface is attached.

"attachment.instance-id"
   The ID of the instance to which the network interface is attached.

"attachment.instance-owner-id"
   The owner ID of the instance to which the network interface is
   attached.

"attachment.status"
   The status of the attachment. Valid Values:
   "attaching|attached|detaching|detached"

"availability-zone"
   The Availability Zone of the network interface.

"description"
   The description of the network interface.

"group-id"
   The ID of a security group associated with the network interface.

"group-name"
   The name of a security group associated with the network interface.

"mac-address"
   The MAC address of the network interface.

"network-interface-id"
   The ID of the network interface.

"owner-id"
   The AWS account ID of the network interface owner.

"private-dns-name"
   The private DNS name of the network interface.

"private-ip-address"
   The private IP address or addresses of the network interface.

"requester-id"
   The ID of the entity that launched the instance on your behalf (for
   example, AWS Management Console, Auto Scaling, and so on).

"requester-managed"
   Indicates whether the network interface is being managed by an AWS
   service (for example, AWS Management Console, Auto Scaling, and so
   on).

"source-dest-check"
   Indicates whether the network interface performs source/destination
   checking. A value of true means checking is enabled, and false
   means checking is disabled. The value must be false for the network
   interface to perform Network Address Translation (NAT) in your VPC.

"status"
   The status of the network interface. If the network interface is
   not attached to an instance, the status shows available ; if a
   network interface is attached to an instance the status shows in-
   use . Valid Values: "available|in-use"

"subnet-id"
   The ID of the subnet for the network interface.

"tag-key"
   The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both
   the filter " tag-key=Purpose " and the filter " tag-value=X ", you
   get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of
   what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what
   the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose
   is X, see the key filter later in this table.

"tag-value"
   The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-key filter.

"tag:"
   --filters the response based on a specific tag/value combination.

"vpc-id"
   The ID of the VPC for the network interface.
