OPTIONAL PARAMETERS

"--offering-type"  (string)The Reserved Instance offering type.

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for ReservedInstances.
   For a complete reference to the available filter keys for this
   operation, see the Amazon EC2 API reference .

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple

         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

            Contains one or more values for the filter.

   the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose
   is X, see the key filter later in this table.

   independent of the tag-key filter.
