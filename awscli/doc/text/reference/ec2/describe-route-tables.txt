describe-route-tables
*********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Gives you information about your route tables. You can filter the
results to return information only about tables that match criteria
you specify. For example, you could get information only about a table
associated with a particular subnet. You can specify multiple values
for the filter. The table must match at least one of the specified
values for it to be included in the results.

You can specify multiple filters (e.g., the table has a particular
route, and is associated with a particular subnet). The result
includes information for a particular table only if it matches all
your filters. If there's no match, no special message is returned; the
response is simply empty.

You can use wildcards with the filter values: an asterisk matches zero
or more characters, and "?" matches exactly one character. You can
escape special characters using a backslash before the character. For
example, a value of "\*amazon\?\\" searches for the literal string
"*amazon?\" .


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws ec2 describe-route-tables
     [--route-table-ids <value>]
     [--filters <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--route-table-ids"  (list of string)
   One or more route table IDs.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for Route Tables. For a
   complete reference to the available filter keys for this operation,
   see the Amazon EC2 API reference .

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

         "values"  (list of string)
            Contains one or more values for the filter.

         "name"  (string)
            Specifies the name of the filter.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      [
        {
          "values":
            ["string", ...],
          "name": "string"
        }
        ...
      ]


FILTERS
=======

"association.main"
   Indicates whether the route table is the main route table for the
   VPC.

"association.route-table-association-id"
   The ID of an association ID for the route table.

"association.route-table-id"
   The ID of the route table involved in the association.

"association.subnet-id"
   The ID of the subnet involved in the association.

"route-table-id"
   The ID of the route table.

"route.destination-cidr-block"
   The CIDR range specified in a route in the table.

"route.gateway-id"
   The ID of a gateway specified in a route in the table.

"route.instance-id"
   The ID of an instance specified in a route in the table.

"route.origin"
   Describes how the route was created.

"route.state"
   The state of a route in the route table. The blackhole state
   indicates that the route's target isn't available (for example, the
   specified gateway isn't attached to the VPC, the specified NAT
   instance has been terminated, and so on). Valid Values:
   "active|blackhole"

"tag-key"
   The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both
   the filter " tag-key=Purpose " and the filter " tag-value=X ", you
   get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of
   what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what
   the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose
   is X, see the key filter later in this table.

"tag-value"
   The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-key filter.

"tag:"
   --filters the response based on a specific tag/value combination.

"vpc-id"
   The ID of the VPC for the route table.
