SYNOPSIS
========

   aws ec2 describe-snapshots
     [--restorable-by-user-ids <value>]
     [--snapshot-ids <value>]
     [--filters <value>]
     [--owner-ids <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--restorable-by-user-ids"  (list of string)
   The optional list of users who have permission to create volumes
   from the described EBS snapshots.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--snapshot-ids"  (list of string)
   The optional list of EBS snapshot IDs to describe.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for Snapshots. For a
   complete reference to the available filter keys for this operation,
   see the Amazon EC2 API reference .

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

         "values"  (list of string)
            Contains one or more values for the filter.

         "name"  (string)
            Specifies the name of the filter.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      [
        {
          "values":
            ["string", ...],
          "name": "string"
        }
        ...
      ]

"--owner-ids"  (list of string)
   The optional list of EBS snapshot owners.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]


FILTERS
=======

"description"
   A description of the snapshot.

"owner-alias"
   The AWS account alias (for example, amazon ) that owns the
   snapshot.

"owner-id"
   The ID of the AWS account that owns the snapshot.

"progress"
   The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage (for example, 80% ).

"snapshot-id"
   The snapshot ID.

"start-time"
   The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.

"status"
   The status of the snapshot. Valid Values: "pending|completed|error"

"tag-key"
   The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both
   the filter " tag-key=Purpose " and the filter " tag-value=X ", you
   get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of
   what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what
   the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose
   is X, see the key filter later in this table.

"tag-value"
   The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-key filter.

"tag:"
   --filters the response based on a specific tag/value combination.

"volume-id"
   The ID of the volume the snapshot is for.

"volume-size"
   The size of the volume, in GiB (for example, 20 ).
