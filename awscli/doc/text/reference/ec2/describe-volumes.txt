Describes the status of the indicated volume or, in lieu of any
specified, all volumes belonging to the caller. Volumes that have been
deleted are not described.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws ec2 describe-volumes
     [--volume-ids <value>]
     [--filters <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--volume-ids"  (list of string)
   The optional list of EBS volumes to describe.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for Volumes. For a
   complete reference to the available filter keys for this operation,
   see the Amazon EC2 API reference .

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

         "values"  (list of string)
            Contains one or more values for the filter.

         "name"  (string)
            Specifies the name of the filter.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      [
        {
          "values":
            ["string", ...],
          "name": "string"
        }
        ...
      ]


FILTERS
=======

"attachment.attach-time"
   The time stamp when the attachment initiated.

"attachment.delete-on-termination"
   Whether the volume is deleted on instance termination.

"attachment.device"
   The device name that is exposed to the instance (for example,
   /dev/sda1).

"attachment.instance-id"
   The ID of the instance the volume is attached to.

"attachment.status"
   The attachment state. Valid Values:
   "attaching|attached|detaching|detached"

"availability-zone"
   The Availability Zone in which the volume was created.

"create-time"
   The time stamp when the volume was created.

"size"
   The size of the volume, in GiB (for example, 20 ).

"snapshot-id"
   The snapshot from which the volume was created.

"status"
   The status of the volume. Valid Values: "creating|available|in-
   use|deleting|deleted|error"

"tag-key"
   The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both
   the filter " tag-key=Purpose " and the filter " tag-value=X ", you
   get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of
   what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what
   the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose
   is X, see the key filter later in this table.

"tag-value"
   The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-key filter.

"tag:"
   --filters the response based on a specific tag/value combination.

"volume-id"
   The volume ID.

"volume-type"
   The Amazon EBS volume type. If the volume is an io1 volume, the
   response includes the IOPS as well. Valid Values: "standard|io1"
