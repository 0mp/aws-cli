describe-vpn-connections
************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Gives you information about your VPN connections.

Warning: We strongly recommend you use HTTPS when calling this operation
  because the response contains sensitive cryptographic information
  for configuring your customer gateway.You can filter the results to
  return information only about VPN connections that match criteria
  you specify. For example, you could ask to get information about a
  particular VPN connection (or all) only if the VPN's state is
  pending or available. You can specify multiple filters (e.g., the
  VPN connection is associated with a particular VPN gateway, and the
  gateway's state is pending or available). The result includes
  information for a particular VPN connection only if the VPN
  connection matches all your filters. If there's no match, no special
  message is returned; the response is simply empty. The following
  table shows the available filters.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws ec2 describe-vpn-connections
     [--filters <value>]
     [--vpn-connection-ids <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for VPN Connections. For
   a complete reference to the available filter keys for this
   operation, see the Amazon EC2 API reference .

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

         "values"  (list of string)
            Contains one or more values for the filter.

         "name"  (string)
            Specifies the name of the filter.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      [
        {
          "values":
            ["string", ...],
          "name": "string"
        }
        ...
      ]

"--vpn-connection-ids"  (list of string)
   A VPN connection ID. More than one may be specified per request.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]


FILTERS
=======

"bgp-asn"
   The BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) associated with a BGP
   device.

"customer-gateway-configuration"
   The configuration information for the customer gateway.

"customer-gateway-id"
   The ID of a customer gateway associated with the VPN connection.

"option.static-routes-only"
   Indicates whether the connection has static routes only. Used for
   devices that do not support Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

"route.destination-cidr-block"
   The destination CIDR block. This corresponds to the subnet used in
   a customer data center.

"state"
   The state of the VPN connection. Valid Values:
   "pending|available|deleting|deleted"

"tag-key"
   The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both
   the filter " tag-key=Purpose " and the filter " tag-value=X ", you
   get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of
   what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what
   the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose
   is X, see the key filter later in this table.

"tag-value"
   The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-key filter.

"tag:"
   --filters the response based on a specific tag/value combination.

"type"
   The type of VPN connection. Currently the only supported type is
   ipsec.1 . Valid Values: "ipsec.1"

"vpn-connection-id"
   The ID of the VPN connection.

"vpn-gateway-id"
   The ID of a virtual private gateway associated with the VPN
   connection.
