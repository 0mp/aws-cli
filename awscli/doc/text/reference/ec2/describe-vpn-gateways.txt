describe-vpn-gateways
*********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Gives you information about your VPN gateways. You can filter the
results to return information only about VPN gateways that match
criteria you specify.

For example, you could ask to get information about a particular VPN
gateway (or all) only if the gateway's state is pending or available.
You can specify multiple filters (e.g., the VPN gateway is in a
particular Availability Zone and the gateway's state is pending or
available).

The result includes information for a particular VPN gateway only if
the gateway matches all your filters. If there's no match, no special
message is returned; the response is simply empty. The following table
shows the available filters.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws ec2 describe-vpn-gateways
     [--vpn-gateway-ids <value>]
     [--filters <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--vpn-gateway-ids"  (list of string)
   A list of filters used to match properties for VPN Gateways. For a
   complete reference to the available filter keys for this operation,
   see the Amazon EC2 API reference .

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for VPN Gateways. For a
   complete reference to the available filter keys for this operation,
   see the Amazon EC2 API reference .

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

         "values"  (list of string)
            Contains one or more values for the filter.

         "name"  (string)
            Specifies the name of the filter.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      [
        {
          "values":
            ["string", ...],
          "name": "string"
        }
        ...
      ]


FILTERS
=======

"attachment.state"
   The current state of the attachment between the gateway and the
   VPC. Valid Values: "attaching|attached|detaching|detached"

"attachment.vpc-id"
   The ID of an attached VPC.

"availability-zone"
   The Availability Zone for the virtual private gateway.

"state"
   The state of the virtual private gateway. Valid Values:
   "pending|available|deleting|deleted"

"tag-key"
   The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both
   the filter " tag-key=Purpose " and the filter " tag-value=X ", you
   get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of
   what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what
   the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose
   is X, see the key filter later in this table.

"tag-value"
   The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is
   independent of the tag-key filter.

"tag:"
   --filters the response based on a specific tag/value combination.

"type"
   The type of virtual private gateway. Currently the only supported
   type is ipsec.1 . Valid Values: "ipsec.1"

"vpn-gateway-id"
   The ID of the virtual private gateway.
