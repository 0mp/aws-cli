The following command lists the jobs you've created::

  aws importexport list-jobs

The output for the list-jobs command looks like the following::

  JOBS    2015-05-27T18:58:21Z    False   EX1ID   Import

You can only list jobs created by users under the AWS account you're currently using. Listing jobs returns useful information, like job ids, which are necessary for other AWS Import/Export commands.
